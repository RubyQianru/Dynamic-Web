# Notes & Process

## Process & Documentation

1. Set up HTML and css file.
2. Create DOM elements in HTML, set class or id for these elements.
3. Add stylings to DOM elements using CSS.
4. Create animations and experiment with keyframes in the style sheet.

## Questions

1. What is the logic behind CSS animations and how are they rendered? 
2. Are there any other ways to implement animations?
